    <h3>A Brief History of Freakin' Lasagna</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>Ancient Freakin' Roots: While we think of lasagna as quintessentially Italian, its origins might lie in ancient Greece. "Laganon" was a flat sheet of dough cut into strips, possibly an early ancestor of pasta. The Romans may have adopted a similar dish they called "lasanum," meaning 'pot' or 'container'.</li>
        <li>Medieval Evolution: The word "lasagna" first appears in written records in the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy. Recipes from this time were quite different, featuring fermented dough instead of fresh pasta, and likely boiled rather than baked. Typical ingredients included cheese and spices.</li>
        <li>Tomato Transformation (Sort Of): Although tomatoes arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, they didn't become a lasagna staple for a couple of centuries. Early "modern" lasagna recipes, especially from Naples, still focused on cheese, meat, and sometimes boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Emilia-Romagna and the Classic: The lasagna we recognize today likely emerged in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy (home to Bologna). This is where the iconic combination of layered pasta, ragù (meat sauce), béchamel sauce, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese gained popularity.</li>
        <li>Global Popularity: Lasagna spread beyond Italy with emigration, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has cemented its place as a beloved comfort food with numerous variations across the globe.</li>
        <li>Important Freakin' Note: Like many traditional dishes, lasagna's history is more of a patchwork than a straight line. Different versions likely existed simultaneously in various regions, making it difficult to pinpoint a single origin.</li>
